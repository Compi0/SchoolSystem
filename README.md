### Introduction
This project is a Python-based application developed for the "Solidaridad" Primary School in San Luis Potos√≠. It allows teachers to manage the school's inventory of materials in an efficient and straightforward way. The application stores data using JSON files due to the small amount of information, making it lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Features

  - View Material Inventory: Users can view the current amount of materials available in the inventory.
  - Track Borrowed Items: The application tracks which materials are borrowed and by whom.
  - Teacher Management: Users can view the list of registered teachers in the system.
  - Add New Records: The application allows the registration of new teachers, new materials, and new borrow requests.
  - Return Borrowed Items: Users have the option to release borrowed materials, returning them to the inventory.
  - Input Validation: All inputs are validated to ensure proper functionality and prevent errors.

## Data Management

  JSON Storage: All data related to materials, teachers, and borrowed items are stored in JSON files. This lightweight format is ideal given the relatively small size of the data and ensures the application remains easy to use and maintain.

## Technologies Used

  Programming Language: Python 3.x
  Data Format: JSON

# Prerequisites

  Python 3.x installed on your machine.
